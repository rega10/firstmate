#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/fm-herdr-legacy-repair.sh - the one guarded repair path for a legacy
# primary-home Herdr task record that predates endpoint_task_id= and therefore
# can never pass fm_backend_validate_task_endpoint (bin/fm-backend.sh), so
# ordinary teardown and control refuse it forever while the watcher keeps
# alerting on its finished endpoint.
#
# The repair BINDS: after every independent evidence check below agrees, it
# rewrites the task's metadata with the single missing endpoint_task_id=<id>
# line. It never closes a pane, never touches a worktree, never deletes any
# record, and never calls a mutating Herdr command - cleanup remains
# bin/fm-teardown.sh's, which re-runs its own complete landed-work test and
# confirmed-close sequence against the now-valid record. Ordinary teardown and
# control keep refusing unbound records implicitly; this explicit path is the
# only place a binding may be restored.
#
# Usage: fm-herdr-legacy-repair.sh <task-id>
#
# Exit 0: the record was repaired, or was already bound to exactly this task
# (idempotent rerun; nothing to do). Exit 1: refused, with one concrete
# diagnostic and every record preserved. Exit 2: usage error.
#
# Independent evidence, all required before the one metadata write:
#   - The record is a regular, single-link, non-symlink primary-home meta file;
#     kind=secondmate, any remote route, and a secondmate FM_HOME all refuse.
#   - backend=herdr exactly; tmux legacy records self-identify through their
#     fm-<id> window name and need no repair, and zellij/orca/cmux legacy
#     records are out of this repair's authorized scope and refuse by name.
#   - endpoint_task_id is absent (the legacy shape). A single binding equal to
#     the task id is the idempotent no-op; an empty, duplicate, or foreign
#     binding refuses.
#   - The record plus the one candidate binding line passes
#     fm_backend_validate_task_endpoint, proving the window, worktree, project,
#     and all four herdr_* fields are present exactly once and consistent.
#   - The recorded worktree is a real git worktree at its own toplevel,
#     distinct from the recorded project, and both share the same origin (or
#     the worktree's origin is the project clone itself).
#   - The worktree is clean (same uncommitted-change test as teardown, with the
#     same harness-artifact allowances) and its committed work has landed:
#     every commit reachable from a remote-tracking ref, or proven landed by
#     bin/fm-landed-lib.sh's shared merged-PR/content-in-default predicates -
#     the same owner bin/fm-teardown.sh uses.
#   - The recorded live endpoint agrees, through read-only Herdr calls against
#     the recorded named session only: either the exact pane is structurally
#     gone (a structured pane_not_found), or it is present with its live
#     tab/workspace topology matching the recorded ids, its tab labeled
#     exactly fm-<id>, its agent absent (restored husk) or registered and
#     idle/done, and its foreground cwd in the recorded worktree (or, for an
#     agent-less restored shell, the recorded creation-time project dir).
#     A working or blocked agent, an unreadable response, an unreachable
#     session, or any topology mismatch refuses.
#
# Filename/task-id agreement alone, labels alone, cwd alone, or a merged PR
# alone never authorize the repair; only the full conjunction does. Any
# missing, duplicate, stale, ambiguous, mismatched, unreadable, live-working,
# unlanded, or dirty evidence refuses with the concrete reason and changes
# nothing. The write itself is atomic (temp file + rename in state/), guarded
# by the task's control and metadata locks, and re-validated after the rename,
# so a rerun at any interruption point converges to the same repaired record.
