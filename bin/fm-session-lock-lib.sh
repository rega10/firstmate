# into an unrelated harness further up the real process tree - for example the

#
# For every harness except Claude the innermost match is the session, which is
# where e.g. Pi's shared signed-wrapper ancestry actually holds the lock: a
# "pi-signed" launcher can be the direct parent of the inner "pi" engine pid that
# owns the lock, and the wrapper pid above it is not that owner. Claude Code
# instead runs hooks several levels below the session inside its own nested
# worker chain (hook shell -> claude bg-spare -> claude bg-pty-host -> claude ->
# claude), with no non-harness process between them. Which pid in that run is the
# session cannot be read off the ancestry at all, so the whole contiguous run is
