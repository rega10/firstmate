# fm-bearings-snapshot.sh - compact, bounded, TOON-by-default bearings projection.
#
# A thin wrapper OVER the canonical bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh. It does not parse
# fleet state itself: it shells out to `fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json`, projects that
# complete structured contract down to the small set of fields a "pick up where I
# left off" read needs, and renders TOON at the output boundary. The internal data
# model stays JSON (`--json` prints it verbatim); TOON is the default agent-facing
# format per the AXI standard, and TOON/JSON are parity representations of the same
# projected model. The projection is view-specific: it DROPS fields from the bearings
# output, it never removes them from - or otherwise weakens - the canonical snapshot,
# which stays complete.
#
# By default the canonical snapshot performs bounded concurrent remote-ledger reads
# for registered remote homes under one shared collection budget and may atomically
# refresh its parent-side ledger cache. It MAY surface PR URLs already recorded in
# task meta (recorded_prs), but performs no live GitHub discovery or checks. Live PR
# discovery/checks happen ONLY under --include-prs; all gh coupling lives in that
# branch and never in the canonical snapshot. The default output states explicitly
# (the prs: line and the omitted[] surfaces) what was not requested, so an absence is
# never ambiguous.
#
# This wrapper consumes canonical status decisions plus canonically normalized
# backlog roles, unresolved blockers, and captain actionability. It never infers
# decisions from report or visual-review prose or reimplements snapshot semantics.
# Underway (in_flight) projects every main live worker plus every active child
# from every readable secondmate ledger, independently of that home's
# current state. A home classified captain_decision because it has an open
# captain hold still contributes each working child as its own Underway row;
# the home row on secondmates[] keeps the decision and gate classification.
# Captain-hold placement follows the canonical snapshot's hold_bucket and
# nothing else; this wrapper never inspects hold reason or body prose. The
# buckets are total and mutually exclusive, so every captain hold appears in
# exactly one decision bucket and none can fall through both. An actively worked
# held task may also appear in Underway. A "live" hold is a default Captain's Call
# entry; "blocked", "dated", and "aged" leave the default Captain's Call, render
# as Charted Next gates stating why (the blocking work, the until date, or the
# floored age), and are counted in omitted[].
# --all-decisions reveals every captain hold available within the bounded snapshot
# and drops its gate, so a hold is never in both Captain's Call and Charted Next.
# Aging is a projection safety net only; the durable
# deferral remains re-holding with --until.
#
# Registered project lifecycle comes from the canonical snapshot's projects[]
# surface (and each secondmate record's own projects[] when present). Identity
# is normalized once against that registry, then posture is applied once to
# every projection. A permanent or future dated park keeps that project's work
# in Charted Next, sorted to the bottom, with `project parked` or
# `project parked until <date>` as the reason, even when the item would otherwise
# be Captain's Call or Underway. A dated park is due and active on its date, so
# the work resurfaces without a registry edit. Archived project work is omitted
# from every work surface and named in omitted[]. Lifecycle never changes
# delivery or merge authority, and it never reclassifies captain holds;
# hold_bucket remains the only hold classification.
#
# Main-home inventory validity comes from the canonical snapshot's main_inventory
# object (orphan structured in-flight without meta, unstructured current rows).
# Bearings never invents Underway rows from backlog-only ids; it discloses those
# gaps in omitted[] and, when invalid, a Charted Next gate line so the four-section
# chat cannot claim an empty fleet while main current state is broken.
#
# The landed section merges this home's Done with the canonical snapshot's
# secondmate_landed roll-up (fm-fleet-snapshot.sh), so merges a secondmate managed -
# recorded in ITS OWN backlog, never the main one - are visible. It stays bounded by
# a per-home cap and an overall cap, with omitted[] disclosure of both and of any
# secondmate home whose backlog was unreadable; no live GitHub call is involved.
# The default landed baseline is balanced across homes: each home keeps its internal
# newest-first ordering, homes iterate in deterministic id order, sparse homes do not
# waste capacity, and --all-landed switches back to the complete global newest-first
# order.

#                    no fleet read, no network. Owned by fm-bearings-contract-lib.sh.
#   --include-prs    ALSO do live GitHub open-PR discovery + checks
#   --fields <list>  opt in to dropped surfaces: bodies,paths,actions,endpoints
#   --all-in-flight  include every in-flight task
#   --all-decisions  include every open decision and captain hold in the bounded snapshot
#   --all-secondmates include every aggregated secondmate record
#   --all-landed     include every landed record from every home (default: bounded)
#   --all-reports    include the full scout-report inventory (default: relevant only)
#   --all-queued     include every queued gate present in the bounded snapshot
#   --all-recorded-prs include every locally recorded PR
#   --all-unhealthy  include every unhealthy endpoint
#   --all-pr-repos   query every discovered repository under --include-prs
#   -h,--help        usage

Compact bearings projection over fm-fleet-snapshot.sh. TOON by default.
Default collection performs bounded concurrent remote-ledger reads for registered
remote homes under one shared snapshot budget and may refresh the parent-side cache.
--include-prs additionally performs live GitHub discovery and checks.

Default fields: schema, home, generated, prs,
  projects{name,posture,parked_until,repo,delivery}, in_flight{id,kind,state,repo,doing},
  secondmates{id,state,doing,provenance,freshness,age_seconds,contradiction,reason},
  secondmate_reconcile{id,spawn_gen,host,kind,ids},
  decisions_open{id,key,verb,summary,owner}, landed{id,what,artifact,owner},
  gates{id,title,blocked_by,reason,owner}, reports{id,path}, recorded_prs{id,url},
  unhealthy_endpoints{...} (only when non-empty), omitted{surface,reveal}.
landed merges this home's Done with registered secondmate homes' Done, bounded by
  a per-home cap (FM_BEARINGS_LANDED_PER_HOME) and an overall cap (FM_BEARINGS_LANDED),
  with omitted[] disclosure. Default selection is balanced across deterministic home
  order while preserving each home's internal newest-first order; sparse homes do
  not waste capacity. --all-landed reveals the full global newest-first set.
For every registered secondmate, readable structured facts from its own home are
  authoritative, including independently trustworthy surfaces from a partial summary.
  Parent events and bounded terminal reads are labeled fallback or contradiction
  evidence and never become current work. The provenance and freshness fields
  distinguish live and cached ledgers; a home without either is explicitly unreadable.
Opt-in surfaces: --fields bodies|paths|actions|endpoints, --all-in-flight,
  --all-decisions (all open decisions and captain holds in the bounded snapshot),
  --all-secondmates, --all-landed, --all-reports, --all-queued, --all-recorded-prs,
  --all-unhealthy, --all-pr-repos, --include-prs (adds candidate_prs).
