# Refresh project clones: fast-forward the checked-out local default branch to
# origin/<default> when safe, and prune local branches whose upstream tracking
# branch is gone (the remote branch was deleted, i.e. its PR merged) and that no
# worktree still needs.
# Self-heals the one unambiguously safe drift: a clean, detached HEAD that holds
# no unique commits (it is an ancestor of origin/<default>) and whose <default>
# branch is free to check out is re-attached and then fast-forwarded ("recovered:").
# Every other off-default state - a non-default named branch, a detached HEAD with
# unique commits, a dirty tree, or a diverged default - may hold real work, so it
# is left untouched and reported as a quantified, loud "STUCK: ... N commits behind
# ... - needs attention" warning rather than a quiet drift. Nothing is ever forced,
# stashed, or discarded.
# Still skips (benignly) local-only/no-origin projects, missing remotes/branches,
# and fetch failures.
# A candidate under projects/ must be the root of its own work tree: git discovery
# walks up, so a plain nested directory would otherwise resolve to the enclosing
# repository (the firstmate checkout) and be synced under that directory's label.
# Anything else is reported as "skipped: not a clone root" naming the repository
# that would have been touched.
# Pruning never deletes the checked-out branch or a branch that still has a
# worktree, so it cannot discard unlanded work; set FM_FLEET_PRUNE=0 to disable it.
# When the fetch fails on an orphaned .git/packed-refs.lock (left by a ref rewrite
# killed mid-write - e.g. a timed-out bootstrap sync or a teardown process kill),
# it is retried with a bounded wait and removed only when provably stale; see
# fetch_with_packed_refs_lock_guard and the FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_* knobs.
# Usage: fm-fleet-sync.sh [<project-dir-or-name>]
#        fm-fleet-sync.sh --active-only
# With no argument every clone under projects/ is refreshed.
# --active-only is the session-start form bin/fm-bootstrap.sh runs: it refreshes
# only the clones named as the `repo` of a backlog item that is In flight or
# Queued (held and blocked items included), because each private-clone fetch can
# cost the operator a separate credential approval. It reads the backlog through
# bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh, bounded at 10s, and prints one summary line before any
# fetch when clones were left out:
#   "fleet: on demand: <n> of <m> project clones have no work under way or
#    queued, so they refresh when work on them starts"
# A clone left out is refreshed by fm-spawn's own fetch when work on it is
# dispatched, and by every other form of this script. A manual backlog backend
# keeps refreshing every clone silently. A backlog that cannot be read - tasks-axi
# absent or incompatible, no readable markdown backlog file, a failed or
# timed-out listing, or output this script cannot parse - also refreshes every
# clone and prints one line naming why, so a failure never silently stops refreshes:
#   "fleet: refreshing every clone: backlog unreadable: <reason>"
# The single-project form accepts either a path (absolute, or relative to the
# caller's cwd) or a bare "<name>"/"projects/<name>" form, resolved against
# this home's projects dir ($FM_HOME/projects, or $FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE).
# Bare names and "projects/<name>" forms prefer this home's projects dir before
# falling back to an explicit path. Example: from anywhere,
# `fm-fleet-sync.sh dotfiles-private` syncs just that one clone, same as
# passing its full projects/dotfiles-private path.
